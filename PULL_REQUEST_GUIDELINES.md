# Pull Request Guidelines

After You Write Your Patch
Once youâ€™ve made your changes, there are a few things to do:

* Make sure linting tasks pass by running eslint, this step is done automatically by commit hook (pre-commit).
* Make sure your code is up-to-date with the latest master: `git pull --rebase`
* Finally, pull request.
