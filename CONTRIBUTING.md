# Contributing to Halo

Halo welcomes contribution from everyone. Here are the guidelines if you are thinking of contributing to us:

## Before Contributing

Before contributing code, please read over the [Code Convention](./CODE_CONVENTION.md) to guarantee the quality of the code.

## Issues

### Where to Find Known Issues
We are using GitHub Issues for our public bugs. We keep a close eye on this and try to make it clear when we have an internal fix in progress. Before filing a new task, try to make sure your problem doesn't already exist.

### Reporting New Issues
When reporting an issue, if it is a bug, please describe it clearly, including the file path, the number of rows. It is best to paste the code over, we will fix it as soon as possible.

## Pull Request Guidelines

After You Write Your Patch
Once youâ€™ve made your changes, there are a few things to do:

* Make sure linting tasks pass by running eslint, this step is done automatically by commit hook (pre-commit).
* Make sure your code is up-to-date with the latest master: `git pull --rebase`
* Finally, pull request.
